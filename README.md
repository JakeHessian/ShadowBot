When a user first joins the Discord server, the user is prompted with a greeting in a DM to run the **.apply** command in a specific text-channel:

Then the application starts in the requested user's DMs:

After the user is completed the application, the bot automatically sends the exported application to a private channel where admins can accept the user for a specific role. The admin must click (react to) the emojis at the bottom of the application for the bot to know to give the user a "Farmer üë©‚Äçüåæ" or "PvP üî´" role. Also, if an admin wishes to deny an applicant, the Admins clicks the ‚õî emoji.

Underneath the exported application, the bot confirms with the admins that their action was registered:
